/**
 * A window on to a drawing, matched to the shape of the panel it is in.
 * SectorSpec 4.4 and SubSectorSpec 4.7.
 *
 * Two maps want the same thing: fill the panel, go in and out on a wheel, move
 * on a drag, and never let the drawing be lost off the edge. The arithmetic is
 * the same for both and lives here, so a chart and a sector map cannot disagree
 * about what zooming means.
 *
 * The view's height is what the zoom sets; the width follows from the panel's
 * shape. That is what fills a wide panel with more map either side rather than
 * with a margin, which is the whole point of matching the aspect rather than
 * letting an SVG letterbox itself.
