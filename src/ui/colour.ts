/**
 * Height to colour. Spec.md section 5: blue for sea, ground colour for land, grey
 * and white for mountains, with the coastline reading the same on the map and on
 * the globe.
 *
 * The sea level moves with the UWP under 5.2, so heights are normalised against it
 * before the ramp is read. The ramp itself still pivots at 0.5, so the sea-land
 * boundary stays the coastline whatever fraction of the world is wet, and a dry
 * world does not come out as one unbroken sheet of mountain.
 *
 * There are two land ramps, not one, and the verdancy of 5.6 says how far between
 * them a world sits. Green is what a watered, breathing, temperate world looks
 * like; a world with none of that is sand and rock, and is drawn in yellows and
 * browns. Both ramps share their stops, so blending them cannot move the coastline
 * or the snow line.
