 *
 * A base is a fact about the system rather than about the chart that draws it,
 * so it lives here where both levels can read it. The chart puts it in the Bases
 * column and draws a mark for it; the system says which orbit it is in, because
 * a naval base is a station in orbit of the main world and a scout way station
 * is a field on it or a tender beside it, and a referee arriving in a system
 * wants to know which rock the navy is parked over.
 *
 * Derived rather than invented, from the main world's own seed, so the chart and
 * the system agree without either of them telling the other: the profile says
 * what quality of port the world has, and the rules say what a port of that
 * quality can carry.
