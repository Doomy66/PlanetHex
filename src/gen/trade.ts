/**
 * The trade classifications a UWP earns, and the population multiplier, belts and

 *
 * These are read off the digits rather than rolled: a world either meets a
 * classification's conditions or it does not, and the same profile always earns
 * the same list. That is what makes them safe to write into an export, where the
 * reader has the UWP in front of them and would notice the two disagreeing.
 *
 * PBG is the one part of a sector line PlanetHex has nothing to say about. No
 * belt, gas giant, or population multiplier is anywhere in the surface, so rather
 * than write zeroes and call them data, the three are drawn from the seed the way
 * everything else about a world is. The same seed brings the same figures, and
 * anyone who wants different ones can type over them where they land.
