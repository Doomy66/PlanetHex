/**
 * How green a world's land is drawn. Spec 5.6.
 *
 * The height ramp of 5.1 was written for an Earth: green lowlands, grey uplands.
 * Most profiles are not an Earth. A world with a trace of unbreathable air, or
 * with a few percent of water, or one that sits too far out for any of it to be
 * liquid, has nothing growing on it, and drawing it green says the opposite of
 * what its digits say.
 *
 * So the ground cover is derived rather than assumed, from the three things
 * plants need and the profile speaks to: air to work with, water to drink, and a
 * temperature at which that water is liquid. Each is a factor in [0, 1] and they
 * multiply, because any one of them at zero is on its own enough to leave a world
 * bare. The result is read as a blend between the green ramp and an arid one, so
 * a marginal world comes out in the yellows and browns between the two rather
 * than having to be either lush or dead.
 *
 * What this is not: a claim about life. A world can be crawling with things that
 * are not photosynthetic, and a referee's world may be covered in something that
 * is not green at all. This is only what the surface of a Traveller world with
 * that profile most plausibly looks like from orbit.
 */

/**
 * How well each atmosphere digit supports ground cover. The breathable middle of
 * the table is what Earth's plants want; the taints cost little, since what makes
 * air unbreathable to a traveller is rarely what a plant minds. Below thin there
 * is not enough gas to hold water on the surface at all, and the exotic, corrosive
 * and insidious digits describe chemistries plants have no purchase on.
