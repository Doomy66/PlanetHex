/**
 * What the ground at a place is made of. Spec 5.8.
 *
 * The verdancy of 5.6 is one number for a whole world, which is as much as a
 * single colour for the whole of it can use. This is the same three factors taken
 * a place at a time: the air and the water are the world's and do not vary, and
 * the warmth is read at the local temperature of 5.7.3, so a world whose mean is
 * temperate is jungle at its equator and tundra at sixty degrees.
 *
 * It was written for the orbital view of 5.7, and for a while it was only that: a
 * number computed per hex, turned into a colour, and thrown away. But a colour is
 * not the answer to the question. What ground a hex is is a fact about the world,
 * and a referee wants it in the hex readout and in the exported table as much as
 * on the map, so the model lives here with the rest of what the world is made of
 * and ui/orbital.ts is left doing what its name says.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a height field. Every function takes the height it is asked
 * about, so the map, the globe, the local panel and the plate all ask the same
 * question of the same model and cannot get different answers.
